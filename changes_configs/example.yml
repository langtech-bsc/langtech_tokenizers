# CHANGES DESCRIPTION:
# This is just an example in which we add 3 different tokens with different types. 
 

# 1- REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
source_model: 'tokenizers/example/example.model'  # The source model to be changed.

reserved_token_pattern: '^<\|reserved_token_[0-9]+\|>$'  # The pattern of the tokens to be replaced (reserved tokens).

original_config: 'tokenizers/example/config.yml'  # The config file of the original tokenizer (if it was trained by BSC). If it does not exist, leave null.

# The available piece types are:
# - `ID=1`: NORMAL
# - `ID=2`: UNKNOWN
# - `ID=3`: CONTROL -> _NOTE: this is different to UNUSED_
# - `ID=4`: USER_DEFINED
# - `ID=5`: UNUSED
# - `ID=6`: BYTE
tokens_to_add:  # Dictionary token-to-type. Check previous lines for available types. Tokens that already exist in the vocabulary will only have their type changed.
  '<user_defined_token>': 4
